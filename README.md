# IS-733-Week4-Datamining
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Decision Tree Classification and Information Gain Analysis** using **Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn**. The dataset used in this analysis is **"tennis.csv"**, which contains weather conditions and their impact on playing tennis.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure (shape, info, and sample rows).
- **Preprocessed categorical features** using **one-hot encoding**.
- **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets for machine learning.
- **Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier**:
  - Used **Entropy (Information Gain)** as the splitting criterion.
  - Trained the model on the dataset.
  - Evaluated performance using **accuracy score and classification report**.
- **Calculated Information Gain** for different attributes to determine their significance in decision-making.

This project provides insights into **how different weather conditions influence the decision to play tennis**, using **decision tree-based classification and entropy-based feature selection**.
